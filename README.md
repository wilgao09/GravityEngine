# GravityEngine

## Purpose
In physics classes, instructors talk about the four fundamental forces (Gravity, the Weak Force, Strong Force, and Electromagnetic Force). However, just saying "they're weak" undermines how weak they actually are. This project seeks to demonstrate how much mass and how small of a distance is required in order to have a meaningful interaction between macroscopic bodies. 

## Background
